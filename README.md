The Money Manager
-latest version as of 8/10/14

This time around, I'm using a tutorial called The Flask Mega-Tutorial.

After going through the official Flask tutorial, I was able to make the money manager app that had just stupid-basic functionality.  Then, I tried to scale it by transitioning from a module layout to a package layout.  However, I had considerable difficulty figuring out where to place everything. For instance, I couldn't seem to get the '__init__.py' right so that the database connection was initialized properly.  This new tutorial is very thorough and goes into a lot of the deeper aspects of Flask development such as keeping all modules in seperate files, migrating to different SQL types, using forms with WTF, datetimes, user login/registration, etc.  I feel I will be much more prepared to deploy a "real" web application after completing this tutorial.
