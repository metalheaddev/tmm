This time around, I'm using a tutorial called The Flask Mega-Tutorial.

After using the official Flask tutorial, I got something that has stupid-basic functionality.  Then, I tried to scale it by transitioning from a model layout to a package layout.  However, I had considerable difficulty figuring out where to place everything. For instance, no matter what I moved around, I couldn't seem to stop an error for "couldn't find attribute get_db."  This new tutorial is very thorough in teaching how to migrate to different SQL types, use forms with WTF, datetimes, user login/registration, etc.  I feel I will be much more prepared to deploy a "real" web-app after completing this tutorial.
